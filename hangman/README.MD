#Hangman Project

##Description
This project aims to build a fully functioning hangman game so the user can guess letters to identify a randomly picked word from the list. The game allows the user to guess a letter and will be able to tell the user weather this is correct or incorrect based on the words in the word_list. 


##Installation instructions
Just download Milestone_5 and run this in Visual Studio or another programme such as Gitbash that accepts Python code.

##Usage instructions
1. Run the code
2. The text will ask the user to select a letter from the list of words, if correct the text will display that it is the correct guess if not the text will prompt the user to try another letter. 
3. Trying the same letter twice will result in a prompt sating this letter has already been tried. 
4. Once all tried (a total of 5) has been exhausted the game will end. 
5. If the user guesses the correct word at the end of the game a text will appear congratulating the player.
